# MID_MODULE
This is the simulation of MID Module. Two layers of 20 plastic scintillation bars. Each bar is 1 m x 0.05 m x 0.01 m. Both layers form an area of  1 m^2 . Above them is a steel absorber. The simulation shoots muons/pions at a distance of 2.8 m above the layers. There is a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. It retrieves data of the 40 bars individually. It gets energy deposition, dE/dx, detected photons and generated photons. The data is save via Ntuples, which you can watch using ROOT.
